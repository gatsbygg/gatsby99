Previous 2 lessons we learnt about basic handling of our bikes. Today our instructor told us we are learning about speed regulating.

**How to slow down when negotiating bend**

1. Before bend, start to slow down with rear brakes
2. Change down gear to 3 or 2 before bend
3. And during the turn don't brake! (it is dangerous to brake as it slows down your bike and makes you lose balance)
4. Always keep eyes on the road in front! prepare to stop if road is not clear after the bend.

This is actually the first time we get to go up to 4th gear in the circuit! After going a few rounds, our instructor asked us to park the bike near the side of the circuit. We are going to learn about slow speed control.

**Slow speed control - 1 metre moving & stopping**

There are 5 cones in front of us. We are supposed to move and stop after each cones.

1. Moving off -> Throttle + half clutch, feed enough power to move off steadily
2. Close throttle prepare to stop
3. Left leg can hang above ground, because it is short distance moving! no need to put of your left leg up to the leg rest!
4. Right leg apply soft rear and also use front brakes
5. Try to practice soft braking. Use less front brake and more rear brakes
6. Because too much front brake will cause you to lose balance of the bike.

**>1.5 metres moving & stopping**

1. Left leg put up to leg rest. Because it is longer distance.
2. Approaching stopping, left leg out
3. Practice gentle braking with rear+front brake

Today our instructor was quite strict like the last lesson. 5 of us only 3 passed.... and I'm one of the 3! YAY, next lesson onwards to 2.01!
