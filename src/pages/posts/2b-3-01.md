Today is an exciting day! We are doing narrow plank and plyon slalom! These 2 are the circuit courses requirement for TP Test!

We start up our bike and did 2 rounds of warm up inside the circuit. We parked our bikes before the narrow plank. Instructor showed us demo how to stay on the narrow plank for 6 seconds or more in Gear 1 half clutch! Then it is our turn to try.

**Narrow Plank:**

* Posture is important! 

1. Relax shoulder 
2. Eyes in front not down
3. Arms to be relaxed not straight
4. Thighs GRIP fuel tank TIGHT

With these steps can help you in balancing

* Low speed control
  1. Maintain half clutch and throttle to power the bike forward 
  2. At same time, apply FOOTBRAKE to maintain low speed and balance
  3. FOOTBRAKE will help you to maintain balance at very low speed  
* You can easily hit 6 seconds or more if you follow the two tips!
