> ### **2nd Dec 2018 was the first lesson of my bike learning journey.**

1. Topped up my account credits at the self-service booths from previous day while opening my account.
2. I bought the essential gears needed the day before. **$2 durian gloves** from the counter, the **white color cap** from the welcome pack, [**$5** **cooling sleeve**](https://www.lazada.sg/products/free-shipping-rockbros-cooling-arm-sleeves-outdoor-sports-sun-uv-protection-covers-breathable-motorcycle-arm-sleeves-i106850545-s691894872.html?spm=a2o42.searchlist.list.1.3fb6449ft06I6N&search=1) from lazada.
3. **Try to reach early to the bike office like 30-15mins earlier.** 
4. Remember to **download BBDC App** ([Apple ](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/bbdc/id1382558683)/ [Android ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bbdc.android.user&hl=en_SG)App Store) login and sign in your attendance for the lesson.
5. Every lesson you will be assigned to a number tag. Refer to the App for your number tag. \[Don't be late! the instructors won't wait for latecomers!! And also it is a waste of your money $29.96/lesson on peak hours:( 
6. Bring your **IC / 11B** along the instructors will need to verify it's you before they start the lessons.

## Lesson 1.01

So excited for my first lesson ever! We have 3 guys and 1 lady attending.

We have a basic orientation:

1. **Pre-move checks**  
   Like powering up the bike, checking headlights, signal lights, brake lights all working  
   Horn working  
   Bike chain working, there is RPM when reving the trottle.
2. **Handling of bike while stationary  
   **How to lift the bike down from main stand, put bike back on main stand.  
   The bike is actually heavy! The CB190R is 150kg!! So it requires some time to get used to balancing it.

   > ### "Pro tip: When putting bike back on main stand, place your right leg on the stand and cross your left leg over to push your weight to pivot over the bike! Like this you will not need to use much of your arm strength which is quite tiring."

3. **Lifting bike up from dropped position  
   **We need to squat and use body weight to push the bike up. When you are outside alone you need to know to pick your own bike up!
4. **Mount the bike  
   **Proceed to the right side of your bike**  
   **Check your blind spot before mounting your bike
5. **Start engine  
   **Turn your key to switch on your power supply to bike  
   Press on the ignition to start up the bike
6. **Practice half clutch control in 1st Gear  
   **This is the main part of the lesson. And the bread and butter of the lessons to come.

   > ### **"**When letting go of the clutch, feel for the biting point. When you feel the bike starts to move, that's the **biting point."**

That's the end of lesson 1.01! After every lesson, you have to get a pass to book the next lesson. And this lesson is pretty much just an orientation. So everyone passed and move on the 1.02!
