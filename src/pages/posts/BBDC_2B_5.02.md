Circuit Evaluation

**Objective:** To complete the circuit test route with **less than 18 demerit points** and **with no immediate failures.**

1. _Warm up round_

   We went around the circuit route once
2. Briefing  
   The instructor then brief us on the mistakes we made during the warm up. Then good luck to us, we went for the evaluation
3. Evaluation **(Tips)**

   This may vary for different people. For me I'm very weak in my S-course, the rest of my subjects I'm ok.
   * Just remember to observe traffic, don't worry about how to pass.
   * Most important is to be SAFE
   * Practice and observe safe riding
   * Check blind spots when needed
   * Give way if needed
   * STOP at STOP LINE
   * Ride at the appropriate speed 
   * Make sure you practice enough to be confident in all the courses
   * Get the basics right and you will be ok!
