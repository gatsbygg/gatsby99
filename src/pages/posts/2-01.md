Today is another day at the circuit, still cannot go out on the road till we get our PDL and lesson 6.0 onwards I think...

So we as per usual we got our IC checked, BBDC App checked by our instructors.

Take our helmets from the rack and chop our bikes.

After a few rounds of warm up going around the circuit, the instructor asked us to park our bike and explain about doing left turn.

**When doing a Left Turn:**

* Regulate speed
* Stop and form up 1 lane if left and right turn sharing the same lane.
* Form up 2 lanes if turn one direction only lane.
* Meaning the lane can form up to 2 bikes per lane, so if left turn sign only, can form up 2 bikes.
* Watch out oncoming from right
* Signal, check blind spot left
* Turn into center of lane
* Practice no wide or sharp turning

> Doing left turn was relatively easy, just that instructor highlighted about checking blind stop and remember to stop before the stop line, then move off after stopping at stop line. Failure to stop at stop line is immediate failure!

After everybody done with the left turn, instructor brought us to the Slope!

**When doing Slope:**

* Move off turn left and switch to gear 2
* Signal Left
* Move up slope in gear 2
* Prepare to stop and form up
* 4 bike max on slope, 1 car max on slope
* Stop in gear 1, always on footbrake, else your bike roll down!

**Moving off slope:**

* Signal Right, check blind spot right
* Turn throttle, release clutch to biting point, throttle more, release footbrake and move up slope
* Going down slope, release clutch FULLY to engage the engine brake
* Slowly brake with both front and rear brakes to stop line

> **Tip:** Before you turn into the slope, check if there is queue on the slope, if full with 4 bikes already, DON'T go up! Queue before the blue sign, in TP test important to stop at correct spot.

That's all for today's lesson, it was fairly easy for all. Instructor told us we are all moving on the lesson 2.02!
