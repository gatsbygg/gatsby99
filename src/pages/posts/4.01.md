Today is all about learning 2 courses that will be performed during the TP test.

Like a circus performance, they are the 'S' course and crank course.

Like usual we had a warm up of two rounds within the training circuit. Then we proceeded to the 'S' course section. Parked our bikes and the instructor demo to us how to do it. He just zipped in and out of the course in less than 9seconds. it looked simple but we all knew in our minds we are going to fail badly!

**'S' Course**

To pass this, we are to complete the 'S' bend smoothly in less than 11 seconds safely.

So we are to wait before the start line behind the cones in 2 files. Wait for the instructor cue to go.

 1. Signal left
 2. Check left blindspot
 3. Increase speed and change to 2nd gear before going into the 'S' course
 4. timing starts after front wheel crosses the dotted line at the 'S' course
 5. Once inside the course maintain throttle
 6. eyes look on where you want to go
 7. if you maintain correct eye direction your body will auto follow to turn the bike to go where you want to go
 8. only apply footbrake if you are going too fast
 9. Before exiting look out for oncoming vehicles
10. Timing stops when front wheel crosses dotted line.
11. Prepare to STOP and give way if got car/bike coming.
12. If not DON'T stop and proceed to turn out.

_Important tips / takeaways:_

* Posture is important, Grip fuel tank, Relax upper body, Eyes look where you want to go, Lean your body with bike during the bend.
* That's why I say your eyes where you look is important, once you look at the correct places your other body posture will follow.
* Before you exit always give yourself time to look for oncoming vehicles.
* So you can prepare yourself to decide if you need to stop. I see many riders lose their balance because they didn't see and expect to stop for oncoming vehicles.
* Oh ya, And also CHECK BLIND SPOTS.
  1. Before going in 'S' course
  2. Before turning left to stop before crank course
* And turn off signal after going into 'S' course. Always forget this one HAHA

**Crank course**

This one is quite simple la, but can be a killer to some riders if they actually lose control and mount the CURB. During TP if mount curb is IMMEDIATE FAIL! So take note of your speed, always dare to throttle abit more when moving off, so you can some power to balance the bike!

Ok, to pass the Crank course, we need to complete the course in less than 6 seconds.

This time we wait in single file, like the 'S' course wait for your turn and cue for you to move off

* Signal right
* Check right blink spot
* increase speed to 2nd gear
* Timing will start after front wheel cross the dotted line inside the course
* Keep closer to the left to give yourself more space to make the right turn
* Keep closer to the right to give yourself more space to make the left turn
* Before exiting, check for oncoming and prepare to stop and give way.
* Timing stops when front wheel crosses dotted line.
