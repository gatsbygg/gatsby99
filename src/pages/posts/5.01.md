Pillion riding + U Turn

**Pillion riding**

Things to note, riding with pillion means:

1. Bike will be heavier
2. Longer braking distance
3. Need to throttle more to move bike
4. Turning is harder, will need to be less sharp

So it just means have to be more careful while taking pillion. Just be always mindful, bike is heavier with 2 pax. Means need more power when pick up. Means turning is heavier. Means slow down earlier too! Be safe!

**U Turn**

U-Turn on bikes is really an art, especially on big bikes.

U-turn is one of the main reason some people fail, because they lose balance and drop their foot result in immediate failure.

To u-turn steadily and safely, there are 3 things to master.

1. Posture
   * Stay relaxed
   * Counter the bike weight when u-turn by leaning your body the opposite side. (Lean to the left side of bike)
   * Eye point at where you want to go (DONT LOOK DOWN at kerb or else where) 
2. Position of bike
   * Stop slightly at 2 'o' clock position so it is easier to turn, compared to the head is straight at traffic.
   * The steering wheel keep straight, don't turn before you move off. (Else you will lose balance)
3. Braking technique **(IMPORTANT)**
   * When you start to move off, try to apply a bit of rear brake.
   * Apply rear brake will keep the bike steady while you U-turn.
   * And keep rear brake on while you throttle and turn.
