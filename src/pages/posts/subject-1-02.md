2nd lesson of the circuit training.

The instructor today looked damn fierce, like no nonsense black face kind. He sounded strict like if we don't meet the requirement for today's tasks he will fail us and we have to come back for the same lesson. STRESSED!

Warmed up our bikes gear up our helmet, gloves and sleeves.

Started out inside the small area within the bike parking area.

**Learned to change up to 3rd gear**

* Start by half clutch + abit of throttle, after picking up some speed.
* To change gear -> Close throttle, clutch in -> Kick up to 2nd gear.
* Gain more speed then repeat again to up 3rd gear.

**Stopping in 1st gear**

* Close throttle, clutch in
* Apply gentle front brake (too hard brake you will get thrown forward!)
* Apply gentle foot brake also
* Kick down to 1st gear and put out left foot
* The put out left foot part is IMPORTANT!
* Is for you to balance the bike when it comes to a complete stop!
* PRACTICE THIS because it is very important to be confident in this action. You need to do this everytime you come to a stop. When in TP test, testers like to give points on this!!

After we are confident in changing gear and stopping, we are brought outside to the REAL circuit! We are to learn how to move and stop in short distances. Like in real traffic jam kind, when traffic is slow, we need to know how to control in low speed.

**Moving and stopping in short distance**

* Throttle with enough power and half clutch during move off
* Maintain posture!!
* Thighs grip gas tank
* Relaxed shoulders
* Relaxed grip on handle bar with 1 finger spacing
* Foot to face inwards to bike
* Eyes on the road in front not on your speedometer

**Coming to a stop**

* Close throttle
* Clutch in
* Apply gentle front brake
* Apply rear brake
* Put left foot out for stopping

And... that is it for lesson 1.02! The instructor was in a super bad mood like kept scolding us . Pointing out like our mistake and say still not steady la... but I passed!! YAY off to lesson 1.03 next!
