Circuit review

To pass today's lesson, we need to complete all the courses within timing and acceptable standard. We will be going through the circuit like the actual TP Test.

Just make sure you do everything like how the instructor taught, and you should be fine.

Some things that instructor told me to improve on

**'S' Course**

Improve on timing (current timing 11s)

Entry point gear 2 straight into the corner and speed up

Into Mid S speed up at straight line

Look out oncoming before exit point

Prepare to stop if there is traffic

Check blind spot after exit at cone

**E Brake**

Close throttle only after line

Brake gradually not to jam brake

Always hold on to front brake

**Pylon plank**

Hold on to foot brake to regulate timing

Try to stay more than 6 seconds on plank

**Right turn**

Form up from right lane

Change lane gradually

Control handle bar don't move with head direction

Thats it for 4.02! Next lesson - Pillion riding & U turns
