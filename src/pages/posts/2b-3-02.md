**Emergency brake**:

Maintain 30-35km/h and brake before the red line.

* Start in gear 1
* pick up speed change gear 2 passing 1st cone
* change to gear 3 at 2nd cone
* Check speed and maintain at 30km/h
* Once cross the white line, apply brake FRONT and REAR.
* **NOTE: Apply both rear and front GENTLY FIRST, THEN HARDER GRADUALY.**
* **IF NOT WILL SLIP AND FALL!!! IT is for your own SAFETY!**
* Stop before the red line, dont need to down gear before stopping. Because everything will happen before you can change your gear.

**Posture when stopping:**

* Keep handle bar straight to maintain balance of bike
* LOOK FORWARD not down!
* Prepare your left leg out to stop

**Moving off after E-brake:**

* Apply front brake
* Start engine
* Check blind spot right, change foot to switch to gear 1
* signal right
* check blind spot left, and foot on rear brake
* Then move off if safe
